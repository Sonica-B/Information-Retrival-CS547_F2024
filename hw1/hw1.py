    # convert the string of terms in text to lower case and replace each character in text, 
    # which is not an English alphabet (a-z) and a numerical digit (0-9), with whitespace.

    # If "text" contains only single term, search it from the inverted index. If "text" contains three terms including "or" or "and", 
    # do OR or AND search depending on the second term ("or" or "and") in the "text".  
    # preconditions: _inverted_index and _documents have been populated from
    #   the corpus.
